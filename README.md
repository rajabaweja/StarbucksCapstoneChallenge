## Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This is Udacity Nanodegree Data Science capstone project - Starbucks Capstone Challenge: How to predict effective offers using user data from the Starbucks App. The data is simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data sets.

## Data Sets <a name="datasets"></a>

The data is contained in three files:

- portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Problem Statement <a name="problem"></a>

I will explore and try to understand more about Starbucks Customers different metrics based on customers personal information. Example is how they are distributed in different groups (gender, income and  more). How the promotion offers affect Customerâ€™s buying behavior.   I will address main business questions below and will build machine learning algorithm to cluster how Starbucks should target the offers.
